  <li>View our <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/blob/master/doc/QUALITY_ASSURANCE.md">Quality Assurance</a> guide to get an idea of proposed workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="compliance">Compliance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We aim for complete C++11/14 compliance; feel free to use this to your advantage with your work</li>
  <li>It is also highly recommended to use the standard library and dependency libraries when possible</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sending-your-work">Sending your work</h2>
<p>To contribute your work, please proceed with the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fork Kovri</li>
  <li>Read our <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/blob/master/doc/STYLE.md">style guide</a></li>
  <li>Create a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">topic branch</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work"><strong>Sign</strong></a> your commit(s)</li>
  <li>Send a pull-request to branch <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>
    <ul>
      <li>We currently do not have any tags as we are in pre-alpha. For now, you can base your work off of master.</li>
      <li>Commit messages should be verbose by default, consisting of a short subject line (50 chars max), a blank line, and detailed explanatory text as separate paragraph(s) - unless the title alone is self-explanatory.</li>
      <li>Commit title should prepend class or aspect of project. For example, &#8220;HTTPProxy: implement User-Agent scrubber. Fixes #193.&#8221; or &#8220;Garlic: fix uninitialized padding in ElGamalBlock&#8221;.</li>
      <li>If a particular commit references another issue, please add a reference. For example &#8220;See #123&#8221;, or &#8220;Fixes #123&#8221;. This will help us resolve tickets when we merge into <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</li>
      <li>In general, commits should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention">atomic</a> and diffs should be easy to read. For this reason, please try to not mix formatting fixes with non-formatting commits.</li>
      <li>The body of the pull request should contain an accurate description of what the patch does and provide justification/reasoning for the patch (when appropriate). You should include references to any discussions such as other tickets or chats on IRC.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="proposals">Proposals</h2>
<p>To contribute a proposal, please review our <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues">open issues</a> for existing proposals. If what you propose is not there, then <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/new">open a new issue</a>.</p>

<p>Even though our C4 dictates that we merge everything, we ask that you open a proposal for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A proposal open up communication</li>
  <li>A proposal show that the contributor respects the input of all project collaborators</li>
  <li>A proposal allows seamless collaborator input in an open forum</li>
  <li>A proposal saves time if a collaborator is working on a similar feature/issue</li>
  <li>A proposal prevents catasrophes and mishaps or allows collaborators to prepare for catasrophes and mishaps</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Not</em> opening a proposal will <em>not</em> prevent you from contributing; we will merge what you PR - but a proposal is highly recommended.</p>

<h2 id="todos">TODO&#8217;s</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do a quick search in the codebase for <code class="highlighter-rouge">TODO(unassigned):</code> and/or pick a ticket and start patching!</li>
  <li>If you create a TODO, assign it to yourself or write in <code class="highlighter-rouge">TODO(unassigned):</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>C4 is meant to provide a reusable optimal collaboration model for open source software projects. It has these specific goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To maximize the scale and diversity of the community around a project, by reducing the friction for new Contributors and creating a scaled participation model with strong positive feedbacks;</li>
  <li>To relieve dependencies on key individuals by separating different skill sets so that there is a larger pool of competence in any required domain;</li>
  <li>To allow the project to develop faster and more accurately, by increasing the diversity of the decision making process;</li>
  <li>To support the natural life cycle of project versions from experimental through to stable, by allowing safe experimentation, rapid failure, and isolation of stable code;</li>
  <li>To reduce the internal complexity of project repositories, thus making it easier for Contributors to participate and reducing the scope for error;</li>
  <li>To enforce collective ownership of the project, which increases economic incentive to Contributors and reduces the risk of hijack by hostile entities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<h3 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The project SHALL use the git distributed revision control system.</li>
  <li>The project SHALL be hosted on github.com or equivalent, herein called the &#8220;Platform&#8221;.</li>
  <li>The project SHALL use the Platform issue tracker.</li>
  <li>The project SHOULD have clearly documented guidelines for code style.</li>
  <li>A &#8220;Contributor&#8221; is a person who wishes to provide a patch, being a set of commits that solve some clearly identified problem.</li>
  <li>A &#8220;Maintainer&#8221; is a person who merges patches to the project. Maintainers are not developers; their job is to enforce process.</li>
  <li>Contributors SHALL NOT have commit access to the repository unless they are also Maintainers.</li>
  <li>Maintainers SHALL have commit access to the repository.</li>
  <li>Everyone, without distinction or discrimination, SHALL have an equal right to become a Contributor under the terms of this contract.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="licensing-and-ownership">Licensing and Ownership</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The project SHALL use a share-alike license, such as the GPLv3 or a variant thereof (LGPL, AGPL), or the MPLv2.</li>
  <li>All contributions to the project source code (&#8220;patches&#8221;) SHALL use the same license as the project.</li>
  <li>All patches are owned by their authors. There SHALL NOT be any copyright assignment process.</li>
  <li>The copyrights in the project SHALL be owned collectively by all its Contributors.</li>
  <li>Each Contributor SHALL be responsible for identifying themselves in the project Contributor list.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="patch-requirements">Patch Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Maintainers and Contributors MUST have a Platform account and SHOULD use their real names or a well-known alias.</li>
  <li>A patch SHOULD be a minimal and accurate answer to exactly one identified and agreed problem.</li>
  <li>A patch MUST adhere to the code style guidelines of the project if these are defined.</li>
  <li>A patch MUST adhere to the &#8220;Evolution of Public Contracts&#8221; guidelines defined below.</li>
  <li>A patch SHALL NOT include non-trivial code from other projects unless the Contributor is the original author of that code.</li>
  <li>A patch MUST compile cleanly and pass project self-tests on at least the principle target platform.</li>
  <li>A patch commit message SHOULD consist of a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, optionally followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description.</li>
  <li>A &#8220;Correct Patch&#8221; is one that satisfies the above requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="development-process">Development Process</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Change on the project SHALL be governed by the pattern of accurately identifying problems and applying minimal, accurate solutions to these problems.</li>
  <li>To request changes, a user SHOULD log an issue on the project Platform issue tracker.</li>
  <li>The user or Contributor SHOULD write the issue by describing the problem they face or observe.</li>
  <li>The user or Contributor SHOULD seek consensus on the accuracy of their observation, and the value of solving the problem.</li>
  <li>Users SHALL NOT log feature requests, ideas, suggestions, or any solutions to problems that are not explicitly documented and provable.</li>
  <li>Thus, the release history of the project SHALL be a list of meaningful issues logged and solved.</li>
  <li>To work on an issue, a Contributor SHALL fork the project repository and then work on their forked repository.</li>
  <li>To submit a patch, a Contributor SHALL create a Platform pull request back to the project.</li>
  <li>A Contributor SHALL NOT commit changes directly to the project.</li>
  <li>If the Platform implements pull requests as issues, a Contributor MAY directly send a pull request without logging a separate issue.</li>
  <li>To discuss a patch, people MAY comment on the Platform pull request, on the commit, or elsewhere.</li>
  <li>To accept or reject a patch, a Maintainer SHALL use the Platform interface.</li>
  <li>Maintainers SHOULD NOT merge their own patches except in exceptional cases, such as non-responsiveness from other Maintainers for an extended period (more than 1-2 days).</li>
  <li>Maintainers SHALL NOT make value judgments on correct patches.</li>
  <li>Maintainers SHALL merge correct patches from other Contributors rapidly.</li>
  <li>The Contributor MAY tag an issue as &#8220;Ready&#8221; after making a pull request for the issue.</li>
  <li>The user who created an issue SHOULD close the issue after checking the patch is successful.</li>
  <li>Maintainers SHOULD ask for improvements to incorrect patches and SHOULD reject incorrect patches if the Contributor does not respond constructively.</li>
  <li>Any Contributor who has value judgments on a correct patch SHOULD express these via their own patches.</li>
  <li>Maintainers MAY commit changes to non-source documentation directly to the project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="creating-stable-releases">Creating Stable Releases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The project SHALL have one branch (&#8220;master&#8221;) that always holds the latest in-progress version and SHOULD always build.</li>
  <li>The project SHALL NOT use topic branches for any reason. Personal forks MAY use topic branches.</li>
  <li>To make a stable release someone SHALL fork the repository by copying it and thus become maintainer of this repository.</li>
  <li>Forking a project for stabilization MAY be done unilaterally and without agreement of project maintainers.</li>
  <li>A stabilization project SHOULD be maintained by the same process as the main project.</li>
  <li>A patch to a stabilization project declared &#8220;stable&#8221; SHALL be accompanied by a reproducible test case.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="evolution-of-public-contracts">Evolution of Public Contracts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All Public Contracts (APIs or protocols) SHALL be documented.</li>
  <li>All Public Contracts SHOULD have space for extensibility and experimentation.</li>
  <li>A patch that modifies a stable Public Contract SHOULD not break existing applications unless there is overriding consensus on the value of doing this.</li>
  <li>A patch that introduces new features to a Public Contract SHOULD do so using new names.</li>
  <li>Old names SHOULD be deprecated in a systematic fashion by marking new names as &#8220;experimental&#8221; until they are stable, then marking the old names as &#8220;deprecated&#8221;.</li>
  <li>When sufficient time has passed, old deprecated names SHOULD be marked &#8220;legacy&#8221; and eventually removed.</li>
  <li>Old names SHALL NOT be reused by new features.</li>
  <li>When old names are removed, their implementations MUST provoke an exception (assertion) if used by applications.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="project-administration">Project Administration</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The project founders SHALL act as Administrators to manage the set of project Maintainers.</li>
  <li>The Administrators SHALL ensure their own succession over time by promoting the most effective Maintainers.</li>
  <li>A new Contributor who makes a correct patch SHALL be invited to become a Maintainer.</li>
  <li>Administrators MAY remove Maintainers who are inactive for an extended period of time, or who repeatedly fail to apply this process accurately.</li>
  <li>Administrators SHOULD block or ban &#8220;bad actors&#8221; who cause stress and pain to others in the project. This should be done after public discussion, with a chance for all parties to speak. A bad actor is someone who repeatedly ignores the rules and culture of the project, who is needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who is offensive, and who is unable to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so by others.</li>
</ul>
